# TDD Algorithms

This is a personal project of mine to practice implementing algorithms, data structures and more using test-driven practices.

Over time I'd like to include most of the items listed on https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university.

I'm a web developer so I'm writing everything in TypeScript to begin with. If I get a chance I might port this to other languages in the future. 

### TODO

- Add Travic CI
- Add test coverage
